        <h1>Everything You Need to Know About ‘ONE PIECE’</h1>
        <h2>Grab your straw hats and climb aboard.</h2>
    </div>

        <h1>What’s the ONE PIECE ?</h1>
        <p>The ONE PIECE universe is the brainchild of Japanese writer and illustrator Eiichiro Oda. Conceived as a
            serialized manga pirate adventure, ONE PIECE debuted in July 1997 in the manga anthology magazine Weekly
            Shōnen Jump. A hit with readers, the first four chapters of ONE PIECE were eventually collected and released
            in December 1997. Since then, there have been 105 (and counting!) collected volumes of ONE PIECE stories,
            all written and illustrated by Oda-Sensei.
            <br> <br>
            In 1999, Toei Animation produced a ONE PIECE 2D animated series based on Oda-Sensei’s work. This brought
            Luffy and his Straw Hat pirates to life in a colorful way that retold their origin story. It gave dedicated
            ONE PIECE readers a slightly different take the books, and was an opportunity to welcome non-readers and
            anime fans into the mythology. It now boasts 20 seasons with over 1,000 episodes of adventures featuring
            Luffy and a huge ensemble of characters.
            <br> <br>
            The ONE PIECE world has also expanded into animated theatrical films. Since March 2000, there have been 15
            movies that add original stories to the mythology, or remix existing stories for the big screen.
        </p>

        <h1>Who is Eiichiro Oda?</h1>
        <p>In the world of publishing, William Shakespeare remains the bestselling fiction GOAT (or Greatest of All
            Time) with approximately 4 billion in sales. But slide down a mere nine slots on that list, and residing at
            No. 10 is Eiichiro Oda. ONE PIECE has sold 516.5 million worth of books, making him the only manga writer
            and illustrator to rank in the Top 10. As such, he’s earned the distinction of being one of the most
            influential manga creators in the history of the medium. With 105 individually collected volumes of ONE
            PIECE stories, Oda-Sensei is the rare manga creator who has remained a singular creative voice charting an
            ongoing, serialized mythology. He plans to personally close it out by 2025.
            <br> <br>
            An interesting fact that even long-time Oda-Sensei fans may not be aware of: He always wanted ONE PIECE to
            be adapted into a live-action series. Various creative false starts and developmental dead-ends delayed that
            endeavor until Netflix partnered with publisher Shueisha and Tomorrow Studios to bring Luffy and his
            eclectic crew of thieves, fighters and dreamers into the real world.
            <br> <br>
            As an executive producer on the series, Oda-Sensei has been deeply involved and played an integral part in
            all aspects of the development, including casting approval, post-production and refining the tone with an
            expert level of detail. He is working closely with executive producers and series showrunners Matt Owens and
            Steven Maeda, and executive producers Marty Adelstein and Becky Clements from Tomorrow Studios. The series
            is a collaboration where the original creator is woven into the fabric of an adaptation team, which ensures
            that the global fans of the manga and anime will see a live-action series that matches the creative
            intentions of Oda-Sensei’s original manga.

        <h1>Why is ONE PIECE so special to fans?</h1>
        <p>ONE PIECE is a legendary high-seas quest unlike any other. Luffy is a young adventurer who has longed for a
            life of freedom ever since he can remember. He sets off from his small village on a perilous journey to find
            the legendary fabled treasure, ONE PIECE, to become King of the Pirates! But in order to find the ultimate
            prize, he will need to assemble the crew he’s always wanted before finding a ship to sail, searching every
            inch of the vast blue seas, outpacing the Marines and outwitting dangerous rivals at every turn.
            <br> <br>
            The heart and soul of the story is Luffy (Iñaki Godoy) and his rambunctious, ragtag crew made up of talented
            misfits called the Straw Hats. Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu) is the ambitious but guarded swordsman. Nami (Emily
            Rudd) is a thief who keeps her secrets close to the vest keeps her secrets close to the vest. Usopp (Jacob
            Romero Gibson) is another dreamer with adventure in his heart. And Sanji (Taz Skylar) is a skilled cook and
            charming rascal. Together, they embody what ONE PIECE is all about: the power of achieving dreams, the bond
            between found family and nakama (close friends) facing hardship together.
            <br> <br>
            The existing fandom of ONE PIECE already consider themselves as de facto Straw Hats, and this series will be
            yet another opportunity to welcome aboard an even bigger contingent of like-minded dreamers from all walks
            of life to join Luffy’s crew.
